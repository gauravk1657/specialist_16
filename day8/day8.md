Controlled Components:
In a controlled component, the form elements (like inputs, selects, and textareas) are fully controlled by React's state. The component's state serves as the "single source of truth" for the values of these elements. When the user interacts with the form elements, React event handlers are used to update the state, and the component re-renders with the updated values. The state is then passed back down to the form elements through their value props, keeping them in sync with the component's state.



Uncontrolled Components:
In an uncontrolled component, the form elements maintain their own internal state. Instead of controlling the form element values through React state, you access their values using references after the user interacts with them. Uncontrolled components are often used when you want to handle form data imperatively, bypassing React's state management.
